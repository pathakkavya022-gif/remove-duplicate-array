here we use int j=0 that hold last unique elements.
int i=0 to compare elementswith last unique element and also hold index of the elements.
j++ means move forward to new unique element.
arr[j]=arr[i] means arr[i] element or ne unique element stored in arr[j].
return j+1 means j can't hold all the elements ,only hold last unique element .
